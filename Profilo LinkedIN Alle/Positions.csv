Tecnema Technology,Sales Engineer,"As a natural prosecution of my professional development I've moved into the Sales Dept. under the direct supervision and guidance of the Sales Director.

By using my technical experience I have been able to support the Area Managers in the lead generation process successfully and followed each single negotiation from the beginning untill the end.  As an Industrial Engineer I have created a free to use CRM within the Trello application that could track the state of advancement of every single deal, and could be used to provide feedback on closingg % for each Area Manager, a great tool for the Sales Director.

Tecnema Technology,Technical Presales Engineer,"I've then moved inside the Technical Dept. of the firm with the main purpose of knowing deeper the products.  I've focused my development on learning the basics of 2D and 3D design of the mechanical components, working with AutoCAD, SolidWorks and SolidEdge, and all related side activities such as coding and BOM management by using the SolidWorks PDM (Product data Management) software.  As an Industrial Engineer I've also kept the focus on my cross-functional tasks towards Sales, Purchase, and Production Depts, by creating shared documents for internal use only in order to maximze the communication and increase efficiency.  My main task towards Sales was designing complete layouts for different production lines during the offering and negotiation phases, working side by side with the sales managers as well as the customers.  Regarding after sales, I've designed the User&Mainteinance manuals of both machines and complete lines as well as spare parts manuals, using InDesign and other graphic tools.  I was also cooperating with the Assistance team to provide them with specific positional and foundations layouts.  This experience has been fundamental in better understanding the products from the technical side and helped me a lot in understanding the processing of ceramic tiles manufacturing: I better understood the functioning and mounting of pre assembled groups, machines and complete lines made of different equipment working in a choerent sequence.   Furthermore I managed the complexity of a BOM on several different levels both for design purposes as well as for a faster production and assembly;  I believe my work has been also significant by implementing new order management procedures that lasted for several years within the company: I've learned the great importance of ""do things right the first time"" in order to avoid issues to the downstream departments, as well as the technical mindset and the key importance of this business unit in any manufacturing company.","Modena Area, Italy - Maranello",May 2011,May 2012
Tecnema Technology,Production Assistant,"Tecnema was a small size company (around 40 employees) with a 30 years experience within the ceramic industry: the company produced machineries and customized production lines for the ceramic business with a focus on cutting, profiling, gluing and squaring of porcelain tiles.  I started out working in Tecnema within the Production Dept., as a trainee, with the following tasks:  • controlling/monitoring the assembling lead times of the equipment in order to increase the efficiency • warehouse management tasks such as picking and pre-assembly preparation • workshop layout improvement • BOM management • non-compliances management with direct support of the engineering department • assembling cost/time detection and allocation for pricing/accounting purposes  I wanted to know more about the product flow within the company so I've decided to start in the workshop, where all the outputs from previous departments are gathering; working here helped me a lot to better understand the flow of raw materials within a manufacturing company and its importance as a key phase for quality and on time deliveries.  As an Industrial Engineer my role has been useful to better connect the workshop to the technical office with measurable improvements on all the above tasks; this experience also helped me a lot in understanding the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) of the company.  By working side by side with the specialized technicians in the workshop I've learned for the first time the importance of teamwork and how great things in business are never done by one person, they're done by a team of people.","Modena Area, Italy - Maranello",Nov 2010,Apr 2011
Tecnoceramica s.r.l.,Process Engineer,"This company was specialized within the finishing of ceramic tiles: squaring, lapping and cutting were the main processings.  I've made this Internship experience to study more in depth the production efficiency of a fully automated line working on ceramic tiles; the goal was to analyze the downtimes and identify a strategy to increase the production output, as well as the revenues for the company following the Lean Manufacturing principles.  My main activities have regarded an in depth efficiency analysis of a cutting and grinding line for ceramic tiles; I've  mapped the existing processes along the line as well as the failures and then I've analyzed the data to develop a different and more efficient production scheduling accordingly to the production orders that needed to be processed.
